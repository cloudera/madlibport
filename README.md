MADlib Port
===========

This project brings in-DBMS data analytics to Impala. This leverages previous
work done by two projects:

  - MADlib (http://madlib.net/)
  - Bismarck (http://hazy.cs.wisc.edu/hazy/victor/bismarck/)

Each of these projects use User Defined Aggregates (UDAs) to train analytic
models using an existing DBMS's data management and processing ability. 


Dependencies:
  - eigen3 (yum install eigen3-devel.noarch, apt-get install libeigen3-dev)
  - boost >= 1.54.0


Code Base
===========
This code base includes the following components.

MADlib
-----------
This is a fork of MADlib 1.0 which has been modified for use with Impala.
The specific changes were:
  - madlib/test with tests for the new code
  - madlib/Makefile to make the tests
  - madlib/src/ports/metaport which is a modified MADlib backend for main memory


Impala UDF
----------

Included as a submodule.  After checking out the main repo, run

    git submodule init
    git submodule update


Example
============

To run the example SVM, 

1. Create database toysvm
2. to register the UDFs with a database (without re-making the binaries), execute: python python/deploy.py -mp toysvm
3. create a synthetic table of examples in the database toysvm with the table toy: python python/gen_classify_data.py toysvm toy
4. python python/impala_svm.py lbl e0 e1 e2 --db toysvm --table toy -e 1
5. impala-shell -q 'use toysvm; select iter, printarray(model) from history;'
